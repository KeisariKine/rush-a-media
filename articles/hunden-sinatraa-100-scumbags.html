            Nicolai &quot;Hunden&quot; Petersen has announced that he and Jay &quot;Sinatraa&quot; Won will be teaming up with Nikhil "Forsaken" Kumawat for a new Valorant roster competing under the name 100 Scumbags

                Following accusations made by the Danish organization Heroic against Hunden, ESIC issued a 2-year ban from most CSGO and other events under ESIC jurisdiction. This left the 30-year-old Dane without a job for the next few years, so he got to work assembling a team in Riot Games' Valorant. Valorant is not under ESIC jurisdiction, and therefore Hunden is allowed to participate in events as he chooses. He quickly teamed up with Jay "Sinatraa" Won and Nikhil "Forsaken" Kumawat to form the new team 100 Scumbags. They were quickly able to find great new sponsors in <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=1">NEOM</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=1">1xBet</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=1">Nestle</a>, and also choose to show support for a great cause with the <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=1">SaveTheKids</a> crypto token 
            </p>
            <p>
                The roster only consists of 2 players and a coach now, but they are in negotiations with many different players about joining their roster with official announcements expected to come after ESIC releases their report about North American Counter-Strike matchfixing. The team has already been talked to Aleksandr "zoneR" Bogatiryev about joining in a management role, and inquired Hovik "KQLY" Tovmassian about interested in joining the roster as a stand-in
