        <p class="description">If you would like to know more about why this site exists please click <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=1">here</a>. But I will offer a short explanation here anyways. So this domain cost like $1 on GoDaddy and I thought it'd be funny to buy it and troll Ryan on Twitter, so I did! And since then it has just existed as a meme because I can't be bothered to really do anything with it and right now I'm mostly just making you read this horrible font for as much as possible. Anyways please click this <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=1">link.</a></p>
